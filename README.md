#Release Note Example Repo

This repository has a basic Node.JS Express project in it.  Every time I update this
repository, we provide details of the change in the commit message.  On occasion, 
the repository will be tagged to denote that a certain body of work has been 
completed at that point in time.  When this happens, management needs a picture of the
work done - outside of our issue management software, as multiple teams may have 
contributed to the codebase.

Your task is to write a script that can gather the changes from any two points in Git 
history and print an unordered list of the commit messages.
